This python file is a collection of fuctions that returns DataFrames
wit filtered information, produce seaborn graphs based on data, and
applies the data machine learning process eventually. Each function
takes in DataFrame read from the main function. The whole purpose of
this python file is an practice exercise for reviewing data visualization,
data managing, and small part of machine learning.
