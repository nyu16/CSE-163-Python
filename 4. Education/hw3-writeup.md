## Why is the `bar_chart_high_school` ineffective, and what do you suggest to improve the plot?

The whole point of plotting graphs is to capture changes/differences of a data and aid in presentation
Though the usage of bar chart two display data with classification was nice, the differences are
barely noticeable. If it were to be me, perhaps I would've readjusted the range of percentage to
better make the differences distinctive - although the numbers were pretty close to one another. Or since
we have other groups as well, perhaps I may included to display the percentages of different ethnicities
within each gender group.


## How and why did you choose the plot for `plot_hispanic_min_degree`?

The reason I chose a line graph is because I wanted to better display the changes over time. According to the data
there were both increases in Hispanic in each degree groups; high school and Bachelor's. Moreover, the change over
time in percetage was more of a regressor graph rather than a classifier. Additionally, the line graph better displayed
the rising/decreasing trend in of different groups in comparison to regression line as well since regression line best
works with individual data points rather than selected groups. Thus I've decided to plot the data using a line graph.


## Describe a possible bias present in this dataset and why it might have occurred.

There could exist various biases. One bias can spring from regions I believe. It could so happen that a certain state
may have more number of Hispanics who acquired degress in comparison to other states. Or perhasp certain data were
omitted because they were dimmed irrelevent or insignificant. For instance, a person was Hispanic, however his/her
nationality was elsewhere and thus the data was omitted in the process. How did they collect data in the first place
and identify whether a person is Hispanic or not? If it was through survey, what if a person confused or lied? If it
was via facial recognition, can the model be trusted?


## Describe an application, analysis, or decision motivated by this dataset with the intended goal of improving educational equity but that ultimately exacerbates social injustice.

I believe equity is a very delicate matter to meddle with. A slight push intended for balance to lead to skewiness,
and to some in could be viewed as discrimination. Perpahs an admissions office might wanted to raise the percentage
of Hispanics with Bachelor's degree so they give advatnages based on ethnicities. This could lead to a similar case
like the affirmative action case - students received benefits based on ethnicities and process resulted in noticeable
discrepencies. Another group could judge Hispanic to be uneducated while reality the reasons could vary. They may
prefer to work at earlier ages. Perhaps the weight of degree isn't as heavy in their society as other socieities.
Perhaps there's a low percentage of Bachelor's across all ethnicities to begin with, not just Hispanics. I believe
data representation and analysis is a delicate process that needs extra care and attention.
