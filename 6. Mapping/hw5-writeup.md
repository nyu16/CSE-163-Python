# Food Desert Analysis

## What is one way that government officials could use `plot_food_access_by_county` or `plot_low_access_tracts` to shape public policy on how to improve food access?
- The plots show clear distinction of level of food access depending on county or regions labelled as either rural or urban.
Based on these data, the government officials can better sort out the priorities - who needs more support and is in quicker
and dire help - and focus resources towards those population. For instance, when looking into the plot of Low Access Census Tracts 
the plot makes clear distinction between states that have low access in comparison to those that are not. Based on these, rather
than providing services and supplies to over all states, the resources or services could be provided for the highlighted regions
first.


## What is a limitation or concern with using the plots in this way?
- Perhaps there exist a chance of data being biased or not being absolute. For instance, low access means not having source of food
like markets within dedicated reach. However, the data could become biased if it so happens that the stores closed only temporarily
due to sudden reasons. Hence, those regions weren't actually regions that needed help the most, but could be labelled as so due to
timely data collection. Or perhaps there could exist a limitation. Looking into different plots in County Food Access plots, specific
regions are highlighted more than other regions, indicating that those regions are in more need of help. However, what if those hightlights
were exaggerated because their populations were less than other regions and therefore show drastic changes easier than others? Other regions
that weren't so highlighted may have more number of people in need of help though they may not show a big number ratio wise.
